TURN UP THE GUITAR(PROJECT)
Our final project aimed to create a user-friendly PC version of the popular mobile phone game
called “Piano Tiles”. We call this game “Turn up the Guitar”. This idea was chosen because all
the digital design concepts that we have learned in the course could be effectively applied to tie
together the different components that the game requires, and further enhanced by our own
intuition to make the game fully functional. The idea of our game is to let players match musical
notes that scroll on-screen at the correct instant, by using the colored buttons in front of them.
Consider the buttons to be the guitar strings for the player, wherein he/she is trying to play the
musical notes as they are generated by the computer in order to score points, and become a rockstar!
